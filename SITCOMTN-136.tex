\setDocAbstract{
An absolute timing calibration for the Rubin Observatory which includes
the clock system and the motion of the camera shutter is necessary to
accurately report the positions of astronomical objects such as asteroids and
the timestamps of transient astronomical phenomenon. The observatory employs
two different clock systems, an NTP based system that should be good to
approximately 1~ms, and a PTP-based system with potential sub-microsecond
accuracy.  The Commissioning Camera used during the first period of Rubin
Observatory commissioning relied on the NTP clock, while the LSST Camera
relies on the PTP-based system.  In this tech-note, an analysis is described
utilizing a GPS system geo-synchronous satellite with precisely known spatial
positions to calibrate the Observatory's NTP based clock.  After corrections
for the camera shutter motion is considered, a $-161.98 \pm 11.06$
milliseconds timing offset is found.  A detailed description of the analysis
is presented along with a proposal for a followup satellite-based timing test
using the LSST Camera.}
